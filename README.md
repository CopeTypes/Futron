# Futron

Futron is a (WIP) CSS/JS framework I'm developing while furthering my web development skills

# Features
-  Simple sections, wrappers, card grids, and navigation, designed around a single page website.
-  A multitiude of built-in components with different themes and (optional) hover effects
    - Navigation bar with dynamic blur
    - Base card with a built in themes and styles (github repo style card, payment plan style card, etc.)
    - Colored and fluid cards can easily be themed and use built-in animations, but support being customized through futron.js
    - Markdown Renderer with code highlighting , powered by [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - extended with Futron's styling & theming
    
-  Built in animations powered by [animate.style](https://animate.style/) - extended by Futron's JS framework for more customization.
     - Apply animations per element or all types of elements
     - Configure animations on view entry/exit, click, and hover, meaning elements can have up to 4 different animations without ever touching the CSS, or worrying about conflicts.

# Customization
- All CSS and JS exported to single files - futron.min.css and futron.min.js, and include all of futron's dependencies (fonts, marked.js, highlight.css, animate.style, etc)
- To update a dependency or change a futron style, make the necessary changes to the CSS or JS file, and run the Futron Builder to create new .min.css and .min.js files with the new dependency or changes.
